        <h2>kushari</h2>
        <p>Koshary, kushari or koshari (Egyptian Arabic: كشرى [ˈkoʃæɾi]) is Egypt's national dish and a widely popular street food.[1] It is a traditional Egyptian staple, mixing pasta, Egyptian fried rice, vermicelli and brown lentils,[2][3] and topped with chickpeas, a garlicky tomato sauce, garlic vinegar, 
          and crispy fried onions. Sprinklings of garlic vinegar and hot sauce are optional.

        <h2>Ful & Taamia</h2>
        <p>Authentic foul (ful) mudammas recipe, made with hearty, creamy fava beans and loaded with flavor from ground cumin, fresh herbs, and a zippy lemon garlic sauce with hot peppers! Don’t worry, the sauce is not spicy, but it adds just the right kick. I use a shortcut in this quick fava beans recipe. Serve it with warm pita bread and sliced veggies. Or turn it into a big vegan feast with sides like tahini, 
          hummus, and roasted cauliflower! Read through for all the tips..
